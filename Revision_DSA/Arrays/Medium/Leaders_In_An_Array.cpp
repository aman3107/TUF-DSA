üîç Intuition:
A leader in an array is an element that is greater than all the elements to its right.
For example, in [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2], the leaders are:
17 (greater than 4, 3, 5, 2),
5 (greater than 2),
2 (rightmost is always a leader).
We need to scan the array from right to left, keeping track of the maximum value seen so far. If the current element is greater than the max, it's a leader.

üß† Approach:
Initialize a result vector ans and store the last element (always a leader).
Initialize maxi as the last element of the array.
Loop from the second last to the first element:
If the current element is greater than maxi, it is a leader:
Update maxi
Add it to the ans vector.
Reverse the ans vector because leaders are collected in reverse order.
Return ans.

Time & Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Single pass from end to start.

Space Complexity: O(k)
Where k = number of leaders stored in ans.
